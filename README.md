## FAQ
### Why was MySocialHelp created?
MySocialHelp was created in response to a question that the New Mexico Governor asked teens to solve in 2023/2024 through the Governor's Stem Challenge. That question was "Now that we live in a post-pandemic world, how can we improve overall mental, physical, or relational health and wellness in our homes, schools, and communities through the use of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)?". To solve this we looked at problems around our school relating to mental health and saw that a lack of social skills post pandemic was a big issue, so we decided to make an app to solve teens' social skills.

### How many people worked on MySocialHelp?
A total of 10 people worked on MySocialHelp. Of those people, 5 worked on the writing of our final quiz and documents for the challenge, and 5 worked on our website. Of the website team 1 person was chosen to bring the website into the form of an app in November.
